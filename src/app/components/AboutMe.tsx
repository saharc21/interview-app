        I'm Sahar Cohen, a passionate software engineer. My mainly profession is
        Front-End developing.
        <br /> Many people aske me: "Sahar, why didn't you decide to go a
        different subject in the whole software world?, Where does the desire
        for FE come from?"
        <br /> To be honest, I love to see things in my eyes, UI developing and
        implemention is the best way to get indication about your writing code.
        <br />
        As a FE developer, I develop my projects with some new and popular
        technologics. Start with React, the most popular library of one single
        page application developing with TypeScript.
        <br /> TypeScript is the best practice we can develop website in a right
        way to prevent bugs and broken values before executing the app. Makes
        our debugging better.
        <br /> In addition, using styled components library to make the app
        style more simpler and clear. With React I mange my states by Hooks for
        local components state and Redux/Mobx for global states who appear and
        affected in many components in our app tree.
